## TCPLightingWebInterface-MQTT - Can be used with MQTT
This is a fork of the fabulous TCPLightingWebInterface (https://github.com/bren1818/TCPLightingWebInterface) created by bren1818.

This fork aims to remove cloud dependance by leveraging MQTT. It also removing the complicated setup by encapsulating it in a Docker container

This is acheived through an additional python script (generated as needed by a PHP script), a couple cron jobs and a small API change
